# Plasma-WebGPU

**Plasma-WebGPU** is an ultra-performant WebGPU game engine built in JavaScript, leveraging JIT-WASM for optimized multi-processor execution. It is designed to rival industry-leading engines like Unity and Unreal Engine 5, providing an advanced framework for creating cutting-edge games.

## Features

- **High Performance:** Utilizes JIT-WASM compilers to leverage multiple processors for shaders and game code execution.
- **N-Dimensional Matrices:** Extends core functionality to handle N-dimensional matrices for tensor calculations, similar to PyTorch.
- **Plasma-Arc Demo:** Showcases the capabilities of the Plasma engine with our exciting tech demo.
- **Modern JavaScript:** Built entirely in JavaScript, taking advantage of the latest WebGPU standards.
